# AIM:
Design a decision tree for following data. 
1 Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
2.Hurt, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
3.Healthy, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
4.Hurt, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
5.Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo -> Defend
# Algorithm:
1. Start the program
2. import the necessary packages 
3. Design a training data and test data 
4. Create a decision tree classifier model
5. Output the predictions 
6. Visualize the decision tree 
# Program:






# Output:



# Result:
Thus the optimum value of max player was found using minimax search.
